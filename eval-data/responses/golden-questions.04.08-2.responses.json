Program Logs:\n   - An ERROR log on January 1st, 2020, shows a database connection failure for mock-app-id.\n   - A WARNING log on the same day indicates a high error rate.\n\n4. Program Metrics:\n   - Recent metrics from February 25th, 2025, show some warnings related to failed user data retrieval and unauthorized access attempts.\n   - There are also variations in response times, CPU usage, and memory usage across different services.\n\nWhile the change request and the program metrics are more recent, the program logs showing database connection failures are from an earlier date.

Can you confirm if 192.168.1.1 is the correct IP address you're inquiring about? It's a common default IP for home routers, so I want to make sure we're looking at the right system.\n\n2. Do you have an application name or application CI ID associated with this IP address? This would help us narrow down the search in the CMDB.\n\n3. If you don't have an application name or CI ID, do you know what type of system this IP belongs to (e.g., server, network device, application)?\n\nOnce you provide this information, I can perform a more targeted search to find the dependencies you're looking for."
