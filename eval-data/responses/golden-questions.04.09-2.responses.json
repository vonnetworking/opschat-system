Incidents:\n   - There are three recent incidents that may be affecting the application and its associated databases:\n     a. Connectivity failure on a server, causing major service disruption across multiple systems.\n     b. Performance degradation in Application Z, possibly causing slowdowns in end-user tasks.\n     c. Unexpected shutdown of a server cluster, resulting in a large-scale service outage.\n\n3. Metrics:\n   - Recent metrics show some warning-level logs and performance issues:\n     a. Failed attempts to retrieve user data.\n     b. High CPU usage (52.22%) in one instance.\n     c. Varying response times, with one instance as high as 2074ms.\n\nThese issues indicate that there are problems affecting the databases and overall system performance associated with mock-app-id. The connectivity failures, server shutdowns, and performance degradations are likely impacting database operations. Additionally, the high CPU usage and long response times suggest that database queries or related processes might be struggling.\n\nTo further investigate and resolve these issues, it would be advisable to:\n1. Check the status of the 'arcadialynx4721' and 'infinitesky245' database systems.\n2. Investigate the root cause of the server connectivity failure and cluster shutdown.\n3.
