Performance degradation in Application Z\n   c. Server cluster shutdown\n\n2. Change Request:\n   There was one recent change request implemented:\n   - Network Security Optimization for mock-app-id\n   - Implemented between January 28-30, 2025\n   - Involved firewall optimization\n   - Required downtime\n\nIt's possible that the network security optimization and firewall changes implemented between January 28-30 could be related to the reported incidents, especially the connectivity failure and performance degradation. The server cluster shutdown might also be a consequence of these changes.\n\nTo further investigate the correlation between these issues and the recent change, we should:\n\n1. Check if the timing of the incidents aligns with the change implementation dates.\n2. Investigate if the firewall optimization affected database connectivity or performance.\n3. Examine if the server cluster shutdown was planned as part of the change or if it was an unexpected consequence.\n\nFor a more detailed analysis, we may need to query additional logs and metrics specifically around the change implementation period."
