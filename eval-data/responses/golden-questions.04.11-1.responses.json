Recent Change:\n   - A change request (number: bb85123e) was implemented for \"Firewall Optimization for Network Security mock-app-id enhancement\" between January 28th and January 30th, 2025.\n   - This change involved downtime and was in the production environment.\n\n2. Recent Incidents:\n   Three incidents were reported, which could potentially be related to the change:\n   a. Connectivity failure on server\n   b. Performance degradation in Application Z\n   c. Unexpected shutdown of server cluster\n\nThese incidents, especially the connectivity failure and server cluster shutdown, could be related to the firewall optimization change. The performance degradation in Application Z might also be a consequence of the network changes.\n\nTo further investigate the correlation, I would recommend:\n1. Checking the exact timing of the incidents in relation to the change implementation.\n2. Reviewing the program logs and metrics for the period immediately before and after the change.\n3. Investigating if there were any rollback procedures or additional changes made after the initial implementation.\n\nWould you like me to gather more specific information about any of these aspects?"
