Performance Degradation: An incident mentions \"Performance degradation - Application Z\" which could be related to database performance issues.\n\n3. Server Cluster Shutdown: There's an incident reporting an \"Unexpected shutdown of server cluster\" which could impact database availability if the databases are part of this cluster.\n\n4. High Response Times: The program metrics show some high response times, particularly for the payment-service, with one instance reaching 2074ms. This could indicate database query performance issues.\n\n5. Resource Usage: There are instances of high CPU usage (up to 52.22%) and varying memory usage, which could affect database performance if these resources are shared with the database servers.\n\n6. Data Retrieval Issues: One of the log messages indicates a failure to retrieve user data, which could be related to database problems.\n\nThese issues suggest that there might be problems with database connectivity, performance, and possibly availability.
