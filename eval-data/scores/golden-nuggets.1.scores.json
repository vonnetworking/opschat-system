The payment service had a high response time in the first entry but improved significantly in the second. The order service shows moderate performance. There's a notable spike in CPU usage for the payment service in the last entry, which might warrant further investigation.",
        "passing": true,
        "score": 4.5,
        "feedback": "The generated answer is highly relevant and correct, providing all the latest metric data for mock-app-id as requested. It includes the same information as the reference answer, with additional context and a brief analysis of the metrics. The slight elaboration on the data's implications is helpful without detracting from the factual response. The only reason it's not a perfect 5 is that it mentions retrieving data \"for the past week,\" which isn't specified in the query or reference answer and might be slightly misleading."

        "feedback": "The generated answer is highly relevant and fully correct. It provides the exact calculation and result as the reference answer, which is 925 milliseconds. Additionally, it offers valuable context by mentioning that the average is based on only three data points from the last week, suggesting that a larger sample size might provide a more comprehensive representation of the app's performance. This extra information enhances the quality of the answer beyond the reference, making it exceptionally helpful for the user."

        "response": "To find the latest error for mock-app-id, we'll need to query the program logs. However, we need some additional information to proceed. Let me ask you a few clarifying questions:\n\n1. What is the specific time range you want to search for errors? We need a begin date and an end date.\n2. Do you have the exact application CI ID for mock-app-id?\n\nOnce you provide this information, I can use the tool_query_program_logs function to retrieve the latest error for you.",

        "feedback": "The generated answer is relevant to the user query as it addresses the task of finding the latest error for mock-app-id. However, it falls short in several ways:\n\n1. It doesn't provide the actual error information that was requested.\n2. It asks for additional information that wasn't necessary, as evidenced by the reference answer which was able to provide the error details without asking for more input.\n3. It suggests using a function (tool_query_program_logs) that may not be available or necessary, as the reference answer didn't mention using any specific tool.\n\nThe answer shows an understanding of the task but fails to deliver the requested information, instead opting to ask for more details. This approach is less helpful than directly providing the available error information, as demonstrated in the reference answer."
