The response demonstrates good problem-solving skills by identifying the need for more specific parameters, but it falls short of delivering the actual transaction times as requested. Therefore, a score of 3 is appropriate, indicating relevance but incomplete fulfillment of the user's request."

Instead, it focuses on the inability to find a Configuration Item associated with the IP address and asks follow-up questions. While this approach is helpful in a broader context, it doesn't provide the specific metric data requested, which is why the score is low.
