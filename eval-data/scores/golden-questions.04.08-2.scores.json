This shows good problem-solving skills and an attempt to assist the user further.\n\nThe response is honest about not finding the information and doesn't make up false data. It also provides potential reasons why the information might not be found (e.g., incorrect application name, different component naming).\n\nHowever, the score is not higher because the answer doesn't directly solve the user's problem. In an ideal scenario, the system would have been able to find and provide the requested IP address. The follow-up questions are helpful, but they require additional effort from the user."
