However, it doesn't directly answer the question about maximum CPU usage in the last 48 hours. Instead, it explains that the application ID \"ABC123\" couldn't be found in the CMDB and asks for verification. This response is appropriate if the application ID is indeed not found, but it doesn't provide the requested information. The answer is professional and helpful in trying to resolve the issue, which is why it receives a score of 3 rather than a lower score.

No program metrics were found for the past week (from January 25th to February 1st, 2025).\n\nThese results suggest that there are no known issues or recent changes that might be affecting the databases associated with ABC123. However, it's worth noting that the absence of reported incidents or metrics doesn't necessarily mean there are no problems. It could also indicate that the monitoring or reporting systems might not be capturing all relevant data.\n\nIs there any specific database issue or behavior you're concerned about?

It also shows proactiveness by acknowledging that the absence of reported issues doesn't necessarily mean there are no problems, which demonstrates a nuanced understanding of IT systems.\n\nThe answer concludes with an offer to investigate further if the user has specific concerns, which is a good practice in customer service and problem-solving.\n\nThe reason for not giving a perfect 5 is that without a reference answer, we can't be absolutely certain that all possible avenues of investigation have been covered.
