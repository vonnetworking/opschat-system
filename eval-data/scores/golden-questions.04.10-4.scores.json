No recent change requests have been logged for this application in the past month.\n4.

The application ABC123 is functioning normally without any database issues.\n2. The application ABC123 might not be correctly registered in our systems, which is preventing us from retrieving relevant information.\n\nTo further investigate, we should verify if the application ID (ABC123) is correct and properly registered in our CMDB.
